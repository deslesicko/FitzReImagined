          <hr class="new4">
          <p class="paragraph mt-0 m-3 pt-3">In 1993, Fitz’s opened in the Delmar Loop area of University City, a suburb of St. Louis. To assure authenticity, the call went out for a vintage bottling line. Incredibly, a 1940’s bottling line was found in an old barn in Shawano, Wisconsin. It was refurbished and installed at the restaurant, where it is visible from every table on the main floor. Fully operational, the bottling line can turn out one bottle of root beer, or any of our other popular flavors, every second. The building that houses Fitz’s was built in 1928 for the West End Bank. It became the Delmar Bank in 1933, and was remodeled in 1944 when the attractive art deco façade was added. For a while, during the 1980’s, it was a Chinese restaurant known as The Lantern House.</p>

          <hr class="new4">
          <p class="paragraph mt-0 m-3 pt-3">Fitz’s Root Beer, our flagship soda, is made according to an original recipe developed in St. Louis in 1947. Our unique formula features fine ingredients including select natural roots, spices, barks and is exclusively sweetened with all natural pure cane sugar. Thanks to its robust and creamy flavor, Fitz’s Root Beer has been recognized as one of the best root beers in the United States.
            We keg Fitz’s Root Beer in 15 gallon barrels in our bottling room right inside our restaurant and serve it ice cold right out of the tap. Our mugs are ‘bottomless’ so come thirsty and enjoy Fitz’s Root Beer, and our other kegged traditional sodas, including Fitz’s Diet Root Beer, Cream Soda, Orange Pop and Black Cherry!</p>
